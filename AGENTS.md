# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## What this is

A Bun workspace monorepo with two apps:

```
apps/web    Next.js frontend (TypeScript, React 19, Tailwind v4)
apps/api    Go HTTP API
docs/       notes on how the pieces fit together
```

`apps/web` has its own `AGENTS.md` with a rule that matters: this is a newer
Next.js than your training data, so read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before
writing frontend code rather than reaching for remembered APIs.

## Commands

Run these from the repo root. The runtime is **Bun**, not Node — use `bun`, not
`npm`/`yarn`.

```sh
bun install       # install workspace deps
bun dev           # web  → http://localhost:3000
bun run dev:api   # api  → http://localhost:8080/health
bun run build     # next build
bun run lint      # eslint over apps/web
bun run --cwd apps/web test:e2e # full two-user browser + stock Git journey
```

There is no root typecheck script. Typecheck the frontend the way CI does:

```sh
cd apps/web && bunx tsc --noEmit
cd apps/api && go vet ./... && go build ./...
```

## What CI checks

Two workflows gate a pull request, each scoped by path — they only run when
that app changed:

- **web** (`apps/web/**`, `package.json`, `bun.lock`) — `bun install
  --frozen-lockfile`, `bun run lint`, `bunx tsc --noEmit`.
- **api** (`apps/api/**`) — `go vet ./...` and `go build ./...` in `apps/api`.

Run the matching commands locally before pushing; the four above are the whole
gate. `bun install --frozen-lockfile` is what CI uses, so commit `bun.lock`
whenever dependencies change or the web job fails before it starts.

## Conventions

- **Frontend** — App Router, file-based routes under `apps/web/src/app`. Entry
  point is `src/app/page.tsx`; `layout.tsx` installs the persistent application
  shell from `src/components/app-shell.tsx`. Reuse the accessible visual
  primitives in `src/components/ui.tsx` and the stroke icon set in
  `src/components/icons.tsx` rather than creating route-local variants.
  Global design tokens, focus treatment, reduced-motion behavior, and base
  styles live in `globals.css`. Tailwind v4 is wired through PostCSS
  (`postcss.config.mjs`); there is no `tailwind.config` file. The shell and
  presentational pages remain Server Components unless an interaction truly
  needs client state. Navigation uses `next/link`; every page renders its
  primary content inside the shell's `#main-content` landmark. Browser API
  calls use the typed helper in `src/lib/api.ts` and same-origin `/api/*`
  requests; clone URLs use same-origin `/git/*`. Next rewrites both to
  `$API_ORIGIN` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8080`). `AuthProvider` retains the API-issued bearer token
  in browser local storage, validates it through `GET /user` at startup, and
  is the shared identity boundary for interactive account and repository
  workflows. Proposal discovery at `/proposals` aggregates the authenticated
  actor's repository catalog and provides repository, status, and text filters;
  durable conversations use `/proposals/{repository-id}/{proposal-id}` for
  attributable comments, author edits, and participant closure controls.
  Pull request discovery at `/pulls` aggregates reviewable work across the
  authenticated actor's repository catalog and opens candidate branches
  against distinct targets with optional proposal context. Durable detail
  routes at `/pulls/{repository-id}/{pull-request-id}` expose the recorded
  branch snapshots, source-only commits, path-ordered file changes, linked
  proposal, attributable discussion, current and stale review decisions,
  source synchronization for authors, server-derived merge blockers, and
  owner-only merge controls. Completed requests retain their merge attribution.
  Owners manage contributors from repository detail pages using the stable
  collaboration ID each user can copy from Settings. The Playwright journey in
  `apps/web/tests` is the connected-product regression and uses isolated
  temporary API storage plus the system Chromium and stock Git clients.
  The authenticated `/activity` workspace shows newest-first attributable
  proposal, pull request, review, merge, mention, and access changes across
  repositories the actor currently collaborates on; directly targeted access
  and mention events remain visible to their affected user.
- **API** — a single `main.go` registering handlers on a `net/http` mux with
  Go 1.22+ method-and-path patterns (`"GET /health"`). It has no third-party
  dependencies and no `go.sum`; adding a dependency means the api workflow's
  `cache: false` line should flip to `cache-dependency-path: apps/api/go.sum`.
  The port comes from `$PORT`, defaulting to `8080`. Bare Git repository
  lifecycle storage lives in `apps/api/storage`; callers create or reopen a
  stable storage ID there before performing repository operations, and
  `Store.Delete` atomically detaches an ID when its repository is removed.
  Deletion uses a stable `.deleting-<id>` tombstone; cleanup failures retain
  that locator, block ID reuse, and are completed by retrying `Store.Delete`.
  `Repository.WriteObject` and `ReadObject` are the durable object boundary;
  they use canonical Git loose-object storage and support blob, tree, commit,
  and annotated tag objects addressed by lowercase SHA-1 object IDs.
  `Repository.ListObjects` discovers every loose object, verifies it through
  the same read boundary, and returns the complete objects ordered by ID.
  `Repository.ReadTree` exposes direct snapshot entries and `WalkTree`
  recursively returns repository paths. `Repository.ReadCommit` exposes a
  commit's tree, ordered parents, headers, and message, while
  `ListCommitAncestry` traverses the complete deduplicated parent graph in
  depth-first parent order.
  Loose references are managed through `CreateReference`, `ReadReference`,
  `UpdateReference`, `ListReferences`, and `DeleteReference`. Direct targets
  must name an existing verified object; symbolic targets may be unborn so
  `HEAD` can identify the default branch before its first commit.
  Reference reads and listings also merge stock Git `packed-refs`, with loose
  references taking precedence, so browser and interoperability reads survive
  normal `git pack-refs` maintenance. Deletion rewrites a matching packed entry
  under Git's standard lock before removing its loose override, preventing
  packed fallback from resurrecting a deleted branch.
  `Repository.Path` is reserved as an interoperability handle for stock Git
  processes; application storage writes should go through the package API.
  The integrated compatibility test builds representative merged history and
  lightweight/annotated tags through that API and requires `git fsck --full`.
  Read-only smart HTTP remotes are exposed at `/git/<storage-id>.git`. Discovery
  and upload-pack RPCs delegate to the installed stock `git` binary, support
  protocol v0 and v2, and advertise unborn `HEAD` so empty repositories retain
  their `main` default branch. Stock Git clones reproduce all advertised,
  reachable objects and check out populated repositories on `main`; empty
  clones retain an unborn local `main`. Existing clones can negotiate and
  fetch later primary-branch objects, update `origin/main`, and fast-forward
  their checkout with a stock `git pull`. `$GIT_STORAGE_ROOT` selects the
  repository root used by the API process and defaults to `repositories`.
  Smart HTTP receive-pack accepts initial, fast-forward, explicitly forced,
  and deletion pushes for every branch under `refs/heads/`; tags and other ref
  namespaces remain denied. Ordinary non-fast-forward pushes are rejected by
  stock clients unless force is requested, and receive-pack applies accepted
  updates transactionally. Stock clients discover and fetch every branch, and
  candidate-branch updates leave `main` unchanged. The end-to-end compatibility
  suite also covers the primary-branch workflow in sequence: initial push,
  clone, ordinary push and pull, forced replacement, deletion, empty clone,
  recovery push, and recovery pull.
  Durable human identities live in `apps/api/users` as atomic JSON records.
  Opaque 128-bit lowercase IDs are permanent attribution keys; handles are
  globally unique and, along with display names, are editable profile data.
  `POST /users`, `GET /users/{id}`, and `PATCH /users/{id}` expose the account
  lifecycle; authenticated consumers resolve their own identity with `GET
  /user`. `$USER_STORAGE_ROOT` selects their directory and defaults to
  `users`. Mutations take a root-wide advisory lock, so handle uniqueness and
  sparse profile patches remain atomic across API processes sharing the root.
  Account creation returns a short-lived session credential and sets the same
  secret as an HttpOnly, Secure cookie. Profile mutations require that actor's
  `profile:write` scope; identity inspection remains public. Durable credential
  records live beneath `$AUTH_STORAGE_ROOT` (default `credentials`) and contain
  only SHA-256 token hashes. Session credentials can create, list, and revoke
  scoped API and Git credentials through `/auth/credentials`; stock Git sends
  its opaque token as the HTTP Basic password. Git transport requires
  `git:read` for upload-pack and `git:write` for receive-pack. Maximum lifetimes
  are 24 hours for sessions, 90 days for API tokens, and 30 days for Git tokens.
  Account bootstrap publishes its user record only after the initial session
  is durable, so a credential failure never reserves the handle; logout only
  reports success after revocation is durable.
  Both stores reconcile exact records after uncertain post-rename failures,
  and a definitively failed user publication revokes its prepared session.
  Repository lifecycle routes are `POST /repositories`, `GET /repositories`,
  `GET /repositories/{id}`, `PATCH /repositories/{id}`, and `DELETE
  /repositories/{id}`.
  Read-only browser routes beneath `/repositories/{id}` expose branches,
  paginated revision ancestry, direct tree entries, and bounded text/binary
  blob inspection.
  Commit pages inspect at most 200 ancestry nodes per request, and blob previews
  verify content in a stream while retaining at most 512 KiB.
  They accept a branch or full commit ID through `ref`, return the resolved
  commit with content, and apply the same public/private collaborator policy
  as repository inspection.
  Repository records have an opaque stable ID, immutable owner, user-facing
  name, `main` default branch, and `/git/<id>.git` remote path. Names are unique
  per owner (case-insensitively), while IDs are shared by application records
  and bare Git storage. `$REPOSITORY_STORAGE_ROOT` selects the private metadata
  root and defaults to `repository-records`. Session and API credentials use
  `repositories:read` and `repositories:write`. Repositories are private by
  default; public reads are anonymous, while private reads, pushes, and
  administration require matching API or Git scope plus repository access.
  Unauthenticated or ungranted non-owners receive not-found where repository
  visibility must be hidden. The repository catalog includes both owned
  repositories and repositories available through current collaborator
  grants. Catalog and credential collection routes use `limit`/`after` cursor pagination (30
  by default, at most 100) and return `next_cursor`. The supported JSON contract
  and stable error envelope are documented in `docs/API.md`. Repository reads
  reconcile metadata with Git storage: records whose Git ID has already
  been detached by deletion are not active, even if metadata cleanup must be
  retried. A Git cleanup error preserves the ownership record so the owner can
  retry deletion; metadata is removed only after Git cleanup succeeds.
  Owners manage durable `contributor` grants through
  `/repositories/{id}/collaborators`. Contributors can inspect and fetch a
  private repository and use Git receive-pack for branches other than `main`;
  default-branch writes, visibility, access management, and deletion remain
  owner-only. Revocation applies on the next request.
  Durable repository proposals live beneath `$PROPOSAL_STORAGE_ROOT` (default
  `proposals`). Owners and contributors can create and discuss proposals;
  authors can edit and close their own proposals, and owners can close any.
  Proposal and immutable comment records retain stable author user IDs. Reads
  inherit repository visibility and private collaborator access, while public
  readability does not grant participation. Proposal and comment collections
  use the shared cursor pagination contract.
  After a proposal mutation's atomic rename, a parent-directory sync failure
  returns the resource with `202` and `Vivarium-Durability: uncertain`; clients
  retain its stable ID and inspect later instead of issuing a duplicate retry.
  Durable pull requests beneath `$PULL_REQUEST_STORAGE_ROOT` (default
  `pull-requests`) are partitioned by repository ID so damaged metadata cannot
  affect another repository's collection. They connect an existing source branch to a distinct target
  branch. Creation snapshots both verified commit IDs, attributes the request
  to its actor, records title/body purpose and optional same-repository
  proposal linkage, and starts it with `open` status. Owners and contributors
  can create them; reads inherit repository visibility and access. Pull request
  collections use shared cursor pagination and creation uses the same uncertain-
  durability response contract as proposals.
  Pull request inspection derives source-only commits and path-ordered file
  changes from the fixed target snapshot and explicitly recorded source
  revision rather than silently following live branches. Authors adopt a
  revised source-branch tip through the public synchronize endpoint; existing
  reviews remain tied to their evaluated commit and require a fresh decision.
  Immutable pull request comments are attributable by stable user ID,
  readable under repository visibility rules, and writable by current owners
  and contributors; comment publication uses the uncertain-durability contract.
  Each owner or contributor can maintain one pull request review decision;
  approvals and change requests snapshot the live source-branch commit,
  replacements retain the review ID, withdrawals remain explicit, and reads
  derive staleness against the current source tip. A deleted or non-commit
  source leaves durable reviews readable and marks them stale. Review
  publication uses the uncertain-durability contract.
  `GET /repositories/{id}/pulls/{pull_id}/merge-readiness` recomputes a
  read-only merge report for current participants. It requires one fresh
  approval and no fresh change request, reports live source/target branch
  state, already-merged state and Git merge conflicts, and separates global
  `mergeable` from owner-only, caller-specific `can_merge`. Conflict
  calculation redirects generated Git objects to temporary storage and must
  not mutate repository objects or references.
  Owners apply ready pull requests with `POST
  /repositories/{id}/pulls/{pull_id}/merge`. Readiness is revalidated, the
  target advances with compare-and-swap protection, and a two-parent commit
  records stable pull-request, proposal, author, and merger attribution. The
  request becomes `merged` with its commit, actor, and timestamp; a linked open
  proposal closes without losing its discussion. Retries reconcile an
  exact commit from private durable server merge intent when it is already
  present in later target ancestry, repairing metadata after publication
  failures without trusting forgeable Git trailers as authorization.
  Meaningful collaboration mutations also append immutable activity events
  beneath `$ACTIVITY_STORAGE_ROOT` (default `activity-records`). Events snapshot the
  repository name and affected resource title while retaining stable actor,
  target-user, repository, and resource IDs. `GET /activity` is authenticated,
  cursor-paginated, and filters ordinary events by current repository access;
  directly targeted mention and access events remain visible after revocation.
- **Docs** — `docs/README.md` records decisions once they're made, not before.
  Update it when you change how the apps fit together, not for every change.

## LADDER.md

`/LADDER.md` at the repo root is **not part of this repository**. It is placed
there from outside the checkout — as a symlink or a read-only bind mount — and
is gitignored for that reason. Read it for context on what is being built, but
never edit it, `git add` it, or delete it, and do not treat its presence as
uncommitted work.
