# Docs

Notes on how this project fits together. Mostly empty for now — things get
written down here as they're decided, not before.

## Entrypoints

- `apps/web` — Next.js frontend. Starts at `src/app/page.tsx`; routes are
  file-based under `src/app`. `bun dev` from the repo root.
- `apps/api` — Go HTTP API. Starts at `main.go`, where routes are registered on
  the mux. `bun run dev:api` from the repo root, serves on `:8080`.

## Git repository storage

The API's `storage` package is the boundary for durable Git repositories. A
filesystem-backed store creates repositories atomically beneath its root as
`<id>.git`, reopens them by the same stable ID, and validates their bare Git
metadata through `Repository.Inspect`. New repositories use `main` as their
unborn default branch and are compatible with stock Git commands through the
absolute path exposed by `Repository.Path`.

Repository IDs are single URL-safe components containing letters, numbers,
dots, underscores, or hyphens. Ownership and user-facing names remain an
application-layer concern; storage IDs only identify a repository boundary.
