# HTTP API contract

The JSON API is the supported application boundary for browsers, agents, and
external consumers. Durable files beneath the configured storage roots are
private implementation details. Git clients use the smart HTTP URLs returned
by repository resources.

## Conventions

- Requests and responses use JSON. Successful resource creation returns `201`
  and a `Location` header; deletion returns `204`.
- A mutation whose atomic rename is visible but whose parent-directory sync
  fails returns `202` with `Vivarium-Durability: uncertain` and the affected
  resource (including its stable ID). Clients must retain that identity and
  inspect it later rather than retrying the mutation as a new request.
- Resource `id` fields are opaque, permanent identities. Display names,
  handles, repository names, and Git remote paths are not attribution keys.
- API credentials use `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The account bootstrap
  session is also set as the `vivarium_session` HttpOnly cookie. Git
  credentials are sent as an HTTP Basic password.
- JSON request bodies reject unknown fields, multiple values, and bodies over
  1 MiB. Validation failures do not partially mutate resources.
- JSON failures have the stable shape
  `{"error":{"code":"machine_readable_code","message":"human readable message"}}`.
  Consumers should branch on `code`, not `message`. Authentication failures
  are `401`, authorization deliberately hidden as not-found is `404`, invalid
  input is `400`, uniqueness conflicts are `409`, and unavailable durable
  storage is `500`.

Collection endpoints accept `limit` (default 30, range 1–100) and `after`.
Responses contain the resource array and `next_cursor`, which is `null` on the
last page. Pass a non-null `next_cursor` unchanged as the next request's
`after`; cursors outside the authenticated collection return
`invalid_pagination`. Collection order is oldest creation first, with opaque ID
as the deterministic tie-breaker.

## Accounts

`POST /users` creates an account from `handle` and `display_name` and returns
`{"user": ..., "credential": ...}`. The credential secret appears only in
that creation response. `GET /user` resolves the currently authenticated
account without requiring a particular scope. `GET /users/{id}` is public and
resolves stable attribution. `PATCH /users/{id}` accepts a sparse `handle`
and/or `display_name` patch from that user with `profile:write`.

Handles are normalized lowercase strings of 1–39 letters, digits, or hyphens.
Display names are one line of 1–100 characters.

## Credentials

`GET /auth/credentials` is a paginated list of the current account's
credentials. `POST /auth/credentials` accepts `kind`, `name`, `scopes`, and an
`expires_in` lifetime in seconds. It returns the secret once. API credentials
may last at most 90 days and Git credentials at most 30 days. `DELETE
/auth/credentials/{id}` revokes one credential; `DELETE /auth/session` revokes
the calling session. Credential administration requires the session-only
`credentials:write` scope.

## Repositories

`POST /repositories` accepts `name` and creates a private repository owned by
the current account. `GET /repositories` paginates that account's repositories.
`GET /repositories/{id}` returns an owned private repository or any public
repository. `PATCH /repositories/{id}` accepts `visibility` as `private` or
`public`; `DELETE /repositories/{id}` removes the owned repository and its Git
remote.

Owners manage limited access with `GET` and `POST
/repositories/{id}/collaborators` and `DELETE
/repositories/{id}/collaborators/{user_id}`. A grant request contains an
existing `user_id`; collaborator resources contain that stable ID and
`role: "contributor"`. Granting the same user and revoking an absent grant are
idempotent. Only the owner may inspect or change grants.

Repository responses include immutable `id` and `owner_id`, user-facing
`name`, `visibility`, `default_branch`, `created_at`, and `git_remote`. Use the
returned `git_remote` relative to the API origin. Private reads and writes
require matching repository or Git credential scopes. Owners retain every
administrative power. Contributors can inspect and fetch a private repository
and can create, update, force-update, or delete non-default branches through
stock Git. They cannot update `main`, change visibility, manage access, or
delete the repository. Revocation takes effect on the next API or Git request.

## Proposals

Repository participants use proposals to establish shared context before or
alongside a code change. `POST /repositories/{id}/proposals` accepts `title`
and `body`; the title is a single line of at most 200 characters and the body
may contain at most 10,000 characters. The resulting resource has an opaque
`id`, immutable `repository_id` and `author_id`, `status: "open"`, and durable
creation and update timestamps. `GET /repositories/{id}/proposals` is
paginated, and `GET /repositories/{id}/proposals/{proposal_id}` inspects one.

The author can update `title` or `body` with `PATCH`; the repository owner can
also close any proposal by sending `status: "closed"`, as can its author. A
closed proposal records `closed_at` and cannot be reopened. Other contributors
cannot rewrite another person's proposal. Owners and contributors can append
feedback with `POST .../comments` using a non-empty `body`; `GET .../comments`
returns the attributable conversation in creation order with pagination.
Comments are immutable and contain stable `author_id` values, so later profile
edits do not alter conversation history.

Proposal reads follow repository visibility: public repository proposals and
comments are anonymously readable, while private reads require the owner or a
current contributor with `repositories:read`. Creation and updates require
`repositories:write`; commenting requires `repositories:read`. Public access
does not itself grant participation. Proposal records are private atomic JSON
files beneath `PROPOSAL_STORAGE_ROOT`, which defaults to `proposals`.
Proposal creates, edits, closes, and comments use the shared uncertain-
durability response when their new state is visible but crash persistence
cannot be confirmed, preserving attribution IDs without overstating storage.

## Pull requests

Repository participants open a pull request with `POST
/repositories/{id}/pulls`. The request requires `title`, `body`,
`source_branch`, and `target_branch`; `proposal_id` may link an existing
proposal in the same repository. Branch names are repository-relative (for
example, `feature`, not `refs/heads/feature`), must be different, and must both
currently identify commit objects. A missing, unborn, or non-commit branch is
rejected without creating a resource.

The created resource records immutable `repository_id` and `author_id`, its
purpose in `title` and `body`, the source and target branch names, and the exact
branch tips as `source_commit_id` and `target_commit_id`. These commit IDs are
snapshots of the requested repository state and do not silently change when a
branch later advances. New pull requests have `status: "open"` and creation
and update timestamps. The linked `proposal_id` is nullable.

`GET /repositories/{id}/pulls` returns pull requests in the shared cursor-
paginated collection shape under `pull_requests`; `GET
/repositories/{id}/pulls/{pull_id}` inspects one. Reads inherit repository
visibility and collaborator access. Creation requires a current owner or
contributor with `repositories:write`; public readability alone does not
grant permission to open a pull request. Pull request metadata is stored as
private atomic JSON beneath `PULL_REQUEST_STORAGE_ROOT`, defaulting to
`pull-requests`, partitioned by repository ID so one repository's damaged
metadata cannot make another repository's collection unavailable. A create
whose rename is visible but directory durability is
uncertain returns the shared `202` response with its stable pull request ID.
